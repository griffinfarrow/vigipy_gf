    "This is a notebook demonstrating how we can use `vigipy` to process the CAERS dataset. This should generalise to any dataset, but Pyspark could be useful to handle the largest databases (e.g. FAERS or Yellow Card)  \n",
    "CAERS is the FDA database of adverse reactions associated with vitamins and food supplements.  \n",
    "The steps in the MGPS algorithm are:\n",
    "- Take in a database of drug-adverse event reports. These are reported in as pairs, so one patient may have many rows associated with them. This should normally come in as a table with columns for `patient_id`, `product_name`, `ae_name` and any stratification variables (like age, sex)\n",
    "- There may be supplementary tables that contain further detailed patient information, drug outcomes, indications etc \n",
    "- This table should be processed to count all the drug-event pairs that appear in the database.\n",
    "- This count method can be extended to also account for drug-drug interactions (or higher order terms)\n",
    "- This table (known as a contingency table) should show how many times each drug-event pair appears in the database, how many time that drug appears (maybe with other events), how many times that event appears (maybe with other drugs) and the total number of reports in the database\n",
    "- That contingency table is processed with the MGPS algorithm to produce an EBGM score for each drug-event pair (or drug-drug-event combiniation). This involves estimating hyperparameters for the distribution of events over the database by maximising a likelihood function.\n",
    "- These hyperparameters are then used to calculate EBGM scores for each drug-event combination and any of them that are above a certain threshold are *suspicious* enough that they should be look at in more detail"

If you use the whole table, you have 1324x2874 terms in your likelihood function, which makes it expensive to calculate\n",
    "Of those ~3 million terms, only 17000 are non-zero. So the safe (and best) thing to do is to just cut off all values that are smaller than 1. That is what truncation does. You *should* always use this, unless you have a reason to avoid it"

    "- Note that the hyperparameters and likelihood are different: you have different background data with all the combinations and so you do produce different parameters \n",
    "- But the signals are largely pretty similar\n",
    "- The differences are essentially due to masking/amplification. When you have combinations of drugs, you flood the database with more reports with very low counts. This tends to reduce all of the signal values because now each of the AEs appear in many more times with the combinations. This is the signal masking that people talk about. You can see this in the datasets: though the signals are broadly quite similar, the `log2` values in the `results_multi` are smaller: they are being masked due to including the combinations\n",
    "- A better idea might be to only include combinations if they appear in the database more than a threshold number of times to avoid this masking effect, or potentially compute them separatelty"
